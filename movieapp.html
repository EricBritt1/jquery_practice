    //2. When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.

    //This is incomplete. Will come back later to finish the movie app I already invested a lot of time on this. Resources felt incomplete. I assumed based on what I learned earlier with DOM that it had to do with e.preventDefault. Wish it was gone over in terms of jQuery as well! Will ask mentor.
